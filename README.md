### Hi there 👋

I'm Pedro Chumpitaz, a data-driven professional with a passion for data science and business. 

I'm currently pursuing a degree in Industrial Engineering at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru and have specializations in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics from CIBERTEC, as well as a Diploma in Digital Transformation from PUCP. 

I have experience in customer behavior research, machine learning, agile methodologies, and data visualization using tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Looker Studio. My technical skills extend to Python, R, SQL, and JavaScript.

🔭 Currently, I'm working with Yape, spearheading cross-functional collaboration to design and implement customer-centric tools and initiatives that drive data-informed marketing strategies.

🌱 I’m constantly learning and expanding my knowledge in the field of data science. Recently, I participated in the OxML 2023 - Machine Learning Program organized by AI for Global Goals and the University of Oxford.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on data-driven projects and initiatives. I'm particularly interested in projects that intersect with my passion for education, as seen in my co-founding of Educando, a digital student platform.
