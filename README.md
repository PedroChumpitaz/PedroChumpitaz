### Hi there 👋

I'm Pedro Chumpitaz, a data-driven professional with a passion for data science and business. 

I hold a degree in Industrial Engineering from the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru and have specializations in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics from CIBERTEC, as well as a Diploma in Digital Transformation from PUCP. 

I have experience in customer behavior research, machine learning, agile methodologies, and data visualization using Tableau, Power BI, and Looker Studio. My technical skills extend to Python, R, SQL, and JavaScript.

🔭 I've worked with companies like Yape and Belcorp, spearheading cross-functional collaboration to design and implement customer-centric tools and initiatives that drive data-informed marketing strategies.

🌱 I’m constantly learning and expanding my knowledge in the field of data science. Recently, I participated in the OxML 2023 - Machine Learning Program organized by AI for Global Goals and the University of Oxford.

⚡ Fun fact: I'm bilingual, fluent in both English and Spanish, and have basic proficiency in Portuguese.
